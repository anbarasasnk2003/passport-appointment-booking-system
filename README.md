This project is used to process the visa and store all the details regarding the passport holder. 
This project will handle all type of visas, and very much concentrate in visa processing. It will 
generate all possible reports, which are need by Consulate. And finally it present more 
flexibility to applicant’s like how much time needed for visa stay. System allows the applicant 
to apply for visa conveniently from anyplace. There are so many visa types provided by the 
government like H1-visa, Dependent visa. Every visa official has a list of requirements 
applicant looks for in a visa application. If they are met, then applicant issues the visa. If not, 
applicant doesn’t. It is how these requirements are met that makes a visa decision seem 
subjective. In Existing system the system has deployed a manual process for visa. Applying & 
Submission of visa application to Visa consultant officer etc all are done manually. The system 
is not transparent to the outside world. Thus, the system needs to be automated.
